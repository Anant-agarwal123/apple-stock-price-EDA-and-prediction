# Apple Stock Price EDA and Prediction

### Objective:
To analyze historical stock prices of Apple Inc. and develop a predictive model for forecasting future stock prices.

### Background:
The project aimed to explore the historical trends in Apple's stock prices and create a predictive model to assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions. By visualizing the data and predicting future prices, the project sought to provide valuable insights into stock market behavior.

### Technologies Used:
+ **Languages:** Python
+ **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Matplotlib and Microsoft Power BI
+ **Model Development:** TensorFlow, Keras
+ **RNN Architecture:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

### Process:
+ Data Collection: Gathered historical stock price data of Apple Inc. from 2014 to 2023.
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover trends and patterns in the data, focusing on close value, open value, volume, and various indicators.
+ Data Visualization: Created an interactive Microsoft Power BI dashboard to visualize the trends and insights from the EDA. The dashboard highlighted key metrics such as closing prices, trading volumes, and stock performance over the years.
+ Data Preprocessing: Transformed and normalized the data to prepare it for time series forecasting. This included handling missing values, scaling, and creating time-based features.
+ Model Development: Developed an LSTM-based model to predict Apple stock prices for the first six months of 2024. The model was trained on the preprocessed data, utilizing the sequential nature of LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies.

### Challenges:
+ Managing and preprocessing large volumes of time series data.
+ Selecting appropriate features and indicators for the predictive model.
+ Fine-tuning the LSTM model to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Outcome:
Successfully developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for visualizing historical stock trends and an LSTM-based model for predicting future stock prices. The model provides reasonably accurate predictions for the stock prices of Apple in the first six months of 2024.

### Future Plans:
Plan to improve the predictive model by incorporating additional features and experimenting with different model architectures. This includes adding macroeconomic indicators, technical analysis metrics, and exploring hybrid models to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Learnings:
+ Gained knowledge about Stock market, various terms related to it and various ternds.
+ Improved skills in time series analysis and preprocessing.
+ Gained experience in developing and fine-tuning LSTM models.
+ Enhanced ability to create interactive data visualizations using Microsoft Power BI.
+ Improved skills in data visualising.
